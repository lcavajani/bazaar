# BAZAAR

This repository is where I store all kind of things I am working/playing with.

The name `bazaar` comes from `bazar` which can be defined:

> an area of small shops and people selling things,
especially in West and South Asia,
or any group of small shops or people selling goods of the same type

The only difference is that there's nothing to sell :smile:
